jquery-free-transform
======================

Provides simple controls that allows you to move/rotate/scale a div. Kind of like a simple version of the free transform tool in Flash or Photoshop.

Dependancies:
  - jQuery - tested with 1.7.2
  - [Matrix.js](https://github.com/STRd6/matrix.js "awesome and simple Matrix lib from STRd6") - awesome and simple Matrix lib from STRd6

TODOs:
  - handle control placement for negative scaling
  - test in IE :)
